# BlinkIT Grocery Sales Analysis: A Strategic Business Perspective

##  Project Overview

In the fast-paced Quick Commerce (Q-Commerce) industry, understanding consumer behavior and outlet performance is vital for operational efficiency. This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on BlinkIT’s grocery sales data to uncover patterns in product demand, outlet profitability, and customer satisfaction.

As a **Data and Business Analyst**, my role involved processing complex sales records to provide actionable insights that help optimize inventory distribution and enhance sales strategies across different geographical tiers and outlet types.

##  Business Problem & Objectives

The primary goal of this analysis is to evaluate the factors influencing grocery sales and identify underperforming segments to drive revenue growth.

### Key Business Questions:

1. **Revenue Drivers:** Which product categories (e.g., Fruits, Snacks, Household) contribute most to total revenue?
2. **Outlet Performance:** How do outlet size and location (Tier 1, 2, 3) impact the average sales and customer ratings?
3. **Inventory Health:** Does item visibility and fat content influence the purchasing decisions of the modern health-conscious consumer?
4. **Operational Maturity:** Is there a correlation between the age of an outlet (Establishment Year) and its sales efficiency?

##  Dataset Description

The analysis is based on a dataset of **8,523 transactions** with **12 key features**.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Item Fat Content` | Category of product health (Low Fat vs. Regular). |
| `Item Type` | The specific category of the grocery item. |
| `Outlet Location Type` | Geographic classification (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3). |
| `Outlet Size` | Physical scale of the outlet (Small, Medium, High). |
| `Outlet Type` | Business model (Grocery Store vs. Supermarket Types). |
| `Sales` | The total revenue generated by the item. |
| `Rating` | Customer satisfaction score (Scale: 1-5). |
| `Item Visibility` | The percentage of total display area allocated to the product. |

##  Tech Stack & Methodology

### Technologies Used:

* **Python:** Core processing and analysis.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** Data cleaning, transformation, and handling inconsistent categorical labels.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Creating high-impact business visualizations.
* **Power BI:** Dashboard.

### Analytical Workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Standardized inconsistent labels in `Item Fat Content` (e.g., merging 'LF', 'low fat' into 'Low Fat').
2. **Missing Value Imputation:** Addressed null values in `Item Weight` to ensure statistical accuracy.
3. **Performance Benchmarking:** Grouped sales data by `Outlet Type` and `Location` to identify high-performing clusters.
4. **Feature Correlation:** Analyzed the relationship between `Item Visibility` and `Sales` to optimize shelf-space logic.

##  Key Insights & Recommendations

* **Top Performers:** 'Fruits and Vegetables' and 'Snack Foods' emerge as the highest revenue-generating categories.
* **Location Strategy:** Tier 3 locations, despite being perceived as less urban, show competitive sales figures, suggesting strong market penetration opportunities.
* **The Satisfaction Gap:** Analysis shows a mean rating of ~3.9. Identifying the specific "Grocery Store" outlets with lower ratings (e.g., Rating < 3) provides a direct target for quality control improvements.
* **Visibility Paradox:** Higher item visibility does not always lead to higher sales, suggesting that product placement logic should be driven by category demand rather than just display area.
